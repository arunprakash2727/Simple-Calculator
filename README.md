# Simple Java Calculator

## Description
This Java program implements a simple calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit). It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The calculator interface includes numeric buttons (0-9), operators (+, -, x, /), an equal (=) button to compute results, and a clear button to reset the input. Users can input arithmetic expressions by clicking on the buttons to perform calculations.

## How to Use
1. Run the `CalculatorDemo.java` file.
2. The calculator GUI window will appear.
3. Use the numeric buttons (0-9) to input numbers for calculations.
4. Use the operator buttons (+, -, x, /) to perform arithmetic operations.
5. Press the "Equal" button (=) to display the result.
6. Press the "Clear" button to reset the input.

## Additional Notes
- The program employs basic event handling with the ActionListener interface to capture button clicks and perform corresponding actions.
- The calculator follows a simple sequential evaluation of expressions, without considering operator precedence or handling decimal inputs.
